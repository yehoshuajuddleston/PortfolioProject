In this SQL code, I'm querying a database that's holding Data Science data to answer questions about various topics. 

#1 What are the salaries of Data Analyst's that are 100% remote?
SELECT salary
FROM dbo.ds_salaries
WHERE job_title = 'Data Analyst'
AND remote_ratio = '100';

#2 What is the average salary in U.S currency for a Senior Level Data Scientist?
SELECT AVG(salary_in_usd)
FROM dbo.ds_salaries
WHERE job_title = 'Data Scientist' 
AND experience_level = 'SE'

#3 How many Machine Learning Engineers reside in the United States?
SELECT COUNT(job_title)
FROM dbo.ds_salaries
WHERE job_title = 'ML Engineer'
AND employee_residence = 'US'

#5 List all salaries from highest to lowest.
SELECT salary
FROM dbo.ds_salaries
ORDER BY salary DESC
