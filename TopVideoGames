Here I will try to give insights to a dataset of the Top Video Games. 

#1 How would you count the number of times Nintendo has appeared in the dataset?
SELECT COUNT(Publisher_s)
FROM videogames
WHERE Publisher_s = 'Nintendo'

#2 How would you not include Pacman and Minecraft in this list?
SELECT * 
FROM videogames
WHERE Title NOT IN ('Pac-Man', 'Minecraft') 

#3 Can you tell us the games with the most sales to the least?
SELECT Title
FROM videogames
ORDER BY Sales DESC

#4 How would you limit to the top five games?
SELECT TOP 5 Title 
FROM videogames
ORDER BY Sales DESC
